# machinery_anomaly_detection
Project of a datascience training

## DCASE 2022 TASK 2
The goal of this project is to get used to datascience research project. The challenge is to detect anomaly using audio sample coming from different type of machineries.
This year the challenge focus on domain generalization. The model should be able to detect anomalies of a machinery even in different environment condition like different factory noies, different voltage applied on the machine etc...

## Currently:
An EDA was made
A first ANN model was trained without success

## Coming
Multi task classification
Auxiliary task classifying type of machineries
Meta learning on embeddings of auxiliary task and modelization of normal samples as Gaussian mixture distributions
