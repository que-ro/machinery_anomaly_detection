# challenge machinery_anomaly_detection
Project of a datascience training

## DCASE 2022 TASK 2
The goal of this project is to get used to datascience research project. The challenge is to detect anomaly using audio sample coming from different type of machineries. <br/>
This year the challenge focus on domain generalization. The model should be able to detect anomalies of a machinery even in different environment condition like different factory noies, different voltage applied on the machine etc...

## Currently:
An EDA was made <br/>
A first ANN model was trained without success <br/>

## Coming
Multi task classification <br/>
Auxiliary task classifying type of machineries <br/>
Meta learning on embeddings of auxiliary task and modelization of normal samples as Gaussian mixture distributions <br/>
